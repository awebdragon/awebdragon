## Hi, I'm Aodhan
Thanks, I picked it myself, it's the Gaelic ancestor of Aiden, I pronounce it like "eye-den".

I'm non-binary! They/them pronouns, please.

I'm a self-taught front end web developer. Basic gist: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, best code/design practices for SEO, ADA compliance. My philosophy is that if I know the fundamental scripting or programming language, then any extension (SASS), library (React), or framework (Foundation) built with that language is something I can easily learn and use. This makes the vast and ever-changing landscape of web development, or any tech, a lot less daunting and a lot more exciting.

With intros out of the way, onto the meat of what I want to use this section for:
