## How I use technical tools

I use code, configuration, and data inspection to understand how platforms or systems behave under real constraints.

## Systems & analysis focus

My professional work centers on requirements translation, platform governance, validation, and operational stability in regulated environments.

### Example: Balancing CMS flexibility with long-term maintainability

- Context: Rebuilding a regulated CMS with competing needs for marketing flexibility, structured data, and future maintainability
- Constraint: Page-builder style customization improved short-term usability but increased long-term migration and support risk
- Decision: Standardized most content on structured templates, with a limited “flex” layout allowing controlled variation; documented clear guidance on when (and when not) to use it
- Outcome: Met stakeholder needs without sacrificing data structure, reduced future migration risk, and improved editor decision-making through documentation
